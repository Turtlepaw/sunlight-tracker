## 🔍 How does it work?
Sunlight Tracker samples the device's light sensor every minute, then it checks if its equals or is more than the threshold, if it's more it will add a sun minute to your daily activity.

## 🕒 How is the battery?
We're currently working to improve the battery by stopping the sampling at night, since there's no sun at night in most places, although this will be optional and user customizable for some cases.
